{"id":"41951","urlID":"2vcit","name":"Full Name Parser w\/prefix\/suffix\/middle","description":"This is very similar to a previous pattern I posted. The differences are that this one breaks out the different parts of the name as follows:\rgroup1 - Prefix (Mr., Mrs., Hon. Sen. etc)\rgroup2 - First Name\rgroup3 - Middle Initial (with .)\rgroup4 - Middle Name\rgroup5 - Last Name\rgroup6 - Pedigree, title string (comma separated)\r\rTo Do: I wish I could figure out how to separate out the pedigrees into their own group. Since multiple pedigrees exist, I can only either pull out the last one, or all of them as a comma separated string. Stil, it works really well.","content":"","weightedVote":"3.26389","numVotes":"1","author":"Jason Burnett","community":"1","dateAdded":"2011-12-03","pattern":"\/^(?:([a-zA-Z]{2,4}\\.){0,1} ?([a-zA-Z]{2,24})) ([a-zA-Z]{1,1}\\. ){0,1}([a-zA-Z]{2,24} ){0,2}([A-Za-z']{2,24})((?:, ([a-zA-Z]{2,5}\\.?)){0,4}?)$\/im\/g","replace":"","state":""}
