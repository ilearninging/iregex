Its emergence can be traced to the early 1960s when businessman Virgilio Hilario opened the first serviced apartment in Asia along the main artery of the first masterplanned community in the Philippines. \n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/fullyfittedinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/discovery-primea.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1616\" title=\"discovery-primea\" src=\"http:\/\/fullyfittedinc.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/discovery-primea-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\"><\/a>\n\nMuch of Ayala Avenue and the Makati business district back then was still newly converted farmland.\n<!--more-->\n\n[ad-gallery]\n\nHilario named his serviced apartment Gilarmi, after his son Gil and his Finnish wife Armi Kuusela. Over time, other residential buildings such as the Urdaneta Apartments, the Twin Towers, and the Ritz Towers were constructed along its row, which came to be known as the Apartment Ridge.\nIn the 1990s, the Gilarmi was acquired by the Tiu family, More than a decade of assiduous study and preparation followed, and in 2008, the redevelopment plan for the site was finally made public. Discovery Primea is the new landmark that will rise on the same ground where Ayala Avenue\u2019s first apartment dwelling was built in the 1960s.\nAfter almost 50 years, a new dawn breaks once more on Apartment Ridge.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[ad-gallery orderby=\"menu_order\"]\n\n","weightedVote":"3.26389","numVotes":"1","author":"mozaix","community":"1","dateAdded":"2014-04-13","pattern":"\/<img.*?wp-image-(\\d*).*?(>|<\\\/img>)\/g","replace":"[[$1]]","state":""}
