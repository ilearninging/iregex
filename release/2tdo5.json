{"id":"20503","urlID":"2tdo5","name":"<a href> to JavaScript","description":"This regexp tries to find complex references to javascript from URLs, if you allow to link things. It also finds complex JavaScript references using HTML entities, as well invalid markup, like forgeting the quotes after href= or using spaces before and after \"=\". which passes though browsers. The pattern below might be incorrectly displayed, because it uses HTML entities which are parsed to actual text by this... thing, causing things like (?::|:|:). <b>HTML entities are very, useful &gt; right?<\/b>\r\rAnd yes, I hacked to one website using HTML entities, so it's awesome regexp.\r\rNote: If you see that < a href=\"javascript:alert(':)');> passes, it's intentional feature, because every browser seems to not accept spaces after < (it replaces them with &lt; in that case).\r\rOh, and if you want to use this for some reason to remove links, you could as well add (?:(.*?)<\/a>)? at end of this and replace it with \/1. I didn't tested this though. It should work, but I'm not sure.\r\rMy mail if you have questions: glitch.mr@gmail.com\r\rAnd yes, I'm coding HTML filter if you want to see - http:\/\/glitchmr.pl\/private\/filter.php6","content":"","weightedVote":"3.21296","numVotes":"4","author":"GlitchMr","community":"1","dateAdded":"2011-03-29","pattern":"<a[^>]*?\\shref\\s*=\\s*\"?\\s*(?:j|&#106;|&#x6a;|&#74;|&#x4a;)(?:a|&#97;|&#x61;|&#65;|&#x41;)(?:v|&#118;|&#x76;|&#86;|&#x56;)(?:a|&#97;|&#x61;|&#65;|&#x41;)(?:s|&#115;|&#x73;|&#83;|&#x53;)(?:c|&#99;|&#x63;|&#67;|&#x43;)(?:r|&#114;|&#x72;|&#82;|&#x52;)(?:i|&#105;|&#x69;|&#73;|&#x49;)(?:p|&#112;|&#x70;|&#80;|&#x50;)(?:t|&#116;|&#x74;|&#84;|&#x54;)(?::|&#58;|&#x3a;).*?\"[^>]*?>?|<a[^>]*?\\shref\\s*=\\s*'?\\s*(?:j|&#106;|&#x6a;|&#74;|&#x4a;)(?:a|&#97;|&#x61;|&#65;|&#x41;)(?:v|&#118;|&#x76;|&#86;|&#x56;)(?:a|&#97;|&#x61;|&#65;|&#x41;)(?:s|&#115;|&#x73;|&#83;|&#x53;)(?:c|&#99;|&#x63;|&#67;|&#x43;)(?:r|&#114;|&#x72;|&#82;|&#x52;)(?:i|&#105;|&#x69;|&#73;|&#x49;)(?:p|&#112;|&#x70;|&#80;|&#x50;)(?:t|&#116;|&#x74;|&#84;|&#x54;)(?::|&#58;|&#x3a;).*?'[^>]*?>?\/gis","replace":"","state":""}
