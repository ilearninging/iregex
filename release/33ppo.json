{"id":"90152","urlID":"33ppo","name":"Find Hash Tags in URL","description":"Find Hashtags in URL\r\rI use this in different variations, substituting the first part with whatever my hashtag represents.\r\rFor example, lets say we have Frogs, those frogs can be green, red, or black.\r\rThe hashtags can look like this:\r#froggies=green\r#froggies=red\r#froggies=black\r\rYou could do this:\r\/#frog[\u001a \\=\\+a-zA-Z0-9_%-]*\/gi\r\rIt will find anything that is a hashtag beginning with frog - then in the resulting URL you can do a .join (stop it from being a clumsy array) and then .replace to eliminate \"#froggies=\" from the string and end up with a nice clean variable result.\r\rI do this for things where I know what the variable catagories will be (selected tabs, frog types, etc) but not what every single variable answer will be (for example, if I add a fifth or sixth tab to something that used to only have four, I don't have to declare each result).\r\rHere's a quick sample of how to use it with some jQuery replacements:\r\rif ( window.location.hash.match(\/#froggies[\u001a \\=\\+a-zA-Z0-9_%-]*\/gi) != null ) {\r\rvar fro_hash = window.location.hash.match(\/#froggies[\u001a \\=\\+a-zA-Z0-9_%-]*\/gi).join(\"\").replace(\"#froggies=\", \"\");\t\r\r$(\".frogtypes\").html(fro_hash)\r}\r\r<div class=\"frogtypes\"><\/div>\r\rIn the abov example it will replace frogtypes div with whatever the defined \"froggies\" variable is set to in the hash.","content":"","weightedVote":"2.5","numVotes":"0","author":"Fujilives","community":"1","dateAdded":"2013-02-15","pattern":"\/#[\u001a \\=\\+a-zA-Z0-9_%-]*\/gi","replace":"","state":""}
