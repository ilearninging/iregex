Beginning at the crest of the Tualatin Mountains, the creek flows generally east down a canyon and through Forest Park, a large municipal park in Portland. It then enters a pipe and remains underground until reaching the river. Danford Balch, after whom the creek is named, settled a land claim along the creek in the 19th century, and was the first person legally hanged in Oregon. Basalt, mostly covered by silt in the uplands and sediment theater in the lowlands, underlies the Balch Creek watershed, which includes the Audubon Society of Portland nature sanctuary. Mixed conifer forest with a well-developed understory of shrubs and flowering plants is the natural vegetation. Sixty-two species of mammals and more than 112 species of birds use Forest Park. A small population of coastal cutthroat trout resides in the stream, which in 2005 was the only major water body in Portland that met state standards for bacteria, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. Although nature reserves cover much of the upper and middle parts of the watershed, industrial sites dominate the lower part","weightedVote":"2.5","numVotes":"0","author":"","community":"1","dateAdded":"2015-09-09","pattern":"(\\b[^\\s]+\\b)?(\\W+)","replace":"","state":"{\"substEnabled\":true}"}
