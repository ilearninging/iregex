Any missing, blank or invalid setting values will be ignored\nand the default value (see below for details on all available settings) will be used.\n\nAVAILABLE SETTINGS\nDefaultBrowser \t- Specify the browser path to be used in cases where a Lookup command\n\t\t\t\t  does not have a _path setting defined. Default is iexplore.exe.\nFadeOnShow\t\t- Enable\/disable the fade-in effect when showing the GUI. Enable fade-in\n\t\t\t\t  by setting to 1.

Default is Arial.\n\n\n\n\nUSER VARIABLES\nThis section contains a user-defined list of variables that correspond to string\n\"replacement\" values. The variables can then be used within any setting value entry using\nthe dereferencing syntax shown in the *how to use* section below.\n\nBUILT-IN VARIABLES\nSETTINGS - Replaced with the full path to the user's settings file\nME       - Replaced with the full path to the user's Jump.ahk file\n\nThese variables are available by default and are handled exactly the same as custom UserVars.\n**BUILT-IN VARIABLE NAMES ARE RESERVED. ENTRIES NAMED THE SAME AS A BUILT-IN ARE IGNORED**\n\nHOW TO USE\nUse a custom variable within a setting value by preceding its name with a dollar-sign, as\nshown in the example below. The variable will be dereferenced (replaced with its value)\nwhen the shortcut or lookup is launched.\n\nBENEFITS OF USERVARS\n* UserVars greatly simplify the process of adding and managing setting entries by reducing\n  the amount of unnecessary duplicate text\n* Readability and organization of settings is greatly increased by using UserVars\n* UserVars allow for the easy creation of dynamic\/context-sensitive setting values, as shown\n  in the example below\n\nEXAMPLE\n> [UserVars]\n> MDOCS = %USERPROFILE%\\Documents\n> PF = C:\\Program Files\n>  \n> [ShortCuts]\n> someFile = $MDOCS\\myFile.exe\n> myProg = $PF\\SomeFolderName\\something.exe\n\n\n\nSHORTCUTS\nThe user's list of shortcut entries. A shortcut entry consists of a trigger string\nand a command; when a shortcut's trigger is entered, its corresponding command is passed\nto the command line and executed. See the [shortcutSettings] section and the [UserVars]\nsection for more info on creating and customizing shortcuts.\n\nEXAMPLE\n> [shortcuts]\n> ie = C:\\Program Files\\Internet Explorer\\iexplore.exe\n\n\n\nSHORTCUT SETTINGS_IN\nSettings that","weightedVote":"2.5","numVotes":"0","author":"WSNHapps","community":"1","dateAdded":"2014-09-24","pattern":"\/^([A-Z][A-Z-_:]+(?:(?:[^\\r\\n]\\s[A-Z-_:]+)?)+)$\/gm","replace":"$1\\r\\n====================","state":""}
