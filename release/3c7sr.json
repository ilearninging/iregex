Only implement if absolutely required and use carefully. See `approveOnce` below for a more limited method.\n\n#### unapprove\n\n```js\nunapprove(address _address) returns (bool success)\n```\nUnapprove address `_address ` to direct debit from your account if it was previously approved. Must reset both one-time and full custody approvals.\n\n#### isApprovedFor\n\n```js\nisApprovedFor(address _target, address _proxy) constant returns (bool success)\n```\nReturns 1 if `_proxy` is allowed to direct debit from `_target`\n\n#### approveOnce\n\n```js\napproveOnce(address _address, uint256 _maxValue) returns (bool success)\n```\nMakes a one-time approval for `_address ` to send a maximum amount of currency equal to `_maxValue`\n\n#### isApprovedOnceFor\n\n```js\nisApprovedOnceFor(address _target, address _proxy) returns (uint256 maxValue)\n```\nReturns `_maxValue` if `_proxy` is allowed to direct debit the returned `maxValue` from address `_target` only once. The approval must be reset on any transfer by `_proxy` of `_maxValue` or less.\n\n### Events\n#### Transfer\n\n```js\nTransfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)\n```\nTriggered when tokens are transferred.\n\n#### AddressApproval\n\n```js\nevent AddressApproval(address indexed _address, address indexed _proxy, bool _result)\n```\nTriggered when an `_address` approves `_proxy` to direct debit from their account.\n\n#### AddressApprovalOnce\n\n```js\nAddressApprovalOnce(address indexed _address, address indexed _proxy, uint256 _value)\n```\nTriggered when an `_address` approves `_proxy` to direct debit from their account only once for a maximum of `_value`","weightedVote":"2.5","numVotes":"0","author":"tgerring","community":"1","dateAdded":"2015-11-17","pattern":"(?:(function|event) )?(\\w+)\\((|(?:(?:, )?\\w+(?:\\[\\])? \\w+)+)\\)((?: (?!returns)\\w+)*)(?: returns \\((|(?:(?:, )?(?:\\w+(?:\\[\\])? )?\\w+)+)\\))?","replace":"","state":"{\"substEnabled\":false}"}
