As reported by Reuters, Exxon Mobil Corporation ( NYSE:XOM) and Qatar Petroleum have shown interest in buying these gas reserves.\nCrude oil prices since June 2014 have fallen more than 50%. Energy companies which have a solid cash position are aiming to take advantage of the price slump by buying assets. For instance, Royal Dutch Shell plc (ADR) ( NYSE:RDS.A ) recently finalized a $70 billion cash-and-share merger with BG Group plc (ADR) ( OTCMKTS:BRGYY ). It is expected that Exxon would be the favorite in attaining these assets. If the company is successful it will be considered its first major acquisition since the crude oil price decline.\nExxon has a wide and diversified range of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) portfolio. As reported by Reuters, the acquisition according to a senior oil banker will gain access to gas assets in the neighboring Tanzania.\nAccording to the sources of Reuters, Anadarko would be selling its 26.5% stake in the Mozambique offshore Area-1 license in the Rovuma Basin. Anadarko previously sold a 10% stake of its gas reserves to an Indian company, called ONGC. The stake was sold for $2.64 billion. Many considered this as overpriced, but the prices of crude oil back then were not as low as they are now.\nAnadarko previously had hoped to build a major LNG export project at Mozambique. The project would be aimed on tapping the Asian markets but with the sale of the stake, the company would have to say goodbye to the export project. The company that would buy the stake would then be responsible for the development of the project.\nThe falling commodity prices have led to major problems for energy companies around the world. Companies that are short on cash are selling assets to survive the downturn. Anadarko Petroleum aims on doing just that and solidify its cash position.\nTotal SA (ADR) ( NYSE:TOT ) in the wake of the lower crude oil prices, sold some of its stake in the invaluable assets in the North Sea Laggan-Tormore oil and gas fields.\nAs reported by Reuters, one of the bankers regarding the LNG export project said: \u201cThis is a $100 billion development that needs developers with significant cash.\u201d He further said: \u201cThe Mozambique government realizes now that it needs to get a top player because if they get it wrong, the project can be delayed by five years.\u201d\nExxon is the largest energy company in the world with ample cash and thus it would be best-suited to develop this project. Exxon in the past has had success with LNG ventures. For instance, it started its Papa New Guinea LNG export project before schedule. Exxon could share its invaluable experience and technical expertise with the Mozambique government.\nOne of the banker sources of Reuters indicated that if Qatar Petroleum buys the stake, it could be a good opportunity for it. He indicated that this would allow Qatar Petroleum to access numerous markets in East Africa. Qatar Petroleum could bank on this opportunity to broaden its expertise in the LNG fiel","weightedVote":"2.5","numVotes":"0","author":"","community":"1","dateAdded":"2015-04-22","pattern":"\/((?:AED|AFN|ALL|AMD|ANG|AOA|ARS|AUD|AWG|AZN|BAM|BBD|BDT|BGN|BHD|BIF|BMD|BND|BOB|BRL|BSD|BTN|BWP|BYR|BZD|CAD|CDF|CHF|CLP|CNY|COP|CRC|CUP|CVE|CZK|DJF|DKK|DOP|DZD|EGP|ERN|ETB|EUR|FJD|FKP|GBP|GEL|GHS|GIP|GMD|GNF|GTQ|GYD|HKD|HNL|HRK|HTG|HUF|IDR|ILS|INR|IQD|IRR|ISK|JMD|JOD|JPY|KES|KGS|KHR|KMF|KPW|KRW|KWD|KYD|KZT|LAK|LBP|LKR|LRD|LTL|LYD|MAD|MDL|MGA|MKD|MMK|MNT|MOP|MRO|MUR|MWK|MXN|MYR|MZN|NAD|NGN|NIO|NOK|NPR|NZD|OMR|PAB|PEN|PGK|PHP|PKR|PLN|PYG|QAR|RON|RSD|RUB|RWF|SAR|SBD|SCR|SDG|SEK|SGD|SHP|SLL|SOS|SRD|SSP|STD|SYP|SZL|THB|TJS|TMT|TND|TOP|TRY|TTD|TWD|TZS|UAH|UGX|USD|UYU|UZS|VEF|VND|VUV|WST|XAF|XCD|XOF|XPF|YER|ZAR|ZMW)|(?:\uc6d0|RMB|\u0440\u0443\u0431|\u0440\u0443\u0431\\.|Lt|\u0631\\.\u0642\\.\u200f|\u0440\\.|\u062f\\.\u0628\\.\u200f|TSh|din\\.|Rp|\u0631|WS\\$|Rs|T\\$|S\\\/\\.|SR|Bs\\.|NOK|CF|Fdj|\u00a3|\u00a4|\u00a5|SEK|Br|Bs|MTn|\u062f\\.\u0623\\.\u200f|\u0434\u0435\u043d|den|RUB|\u0623\\.\u0645\\.\u200f|\u043b\u0432\\.|\u0928\u0947\u0930\u0942|DA|z\u0142|Nfk|\u0434\u0438\u043d|\u0434\u0438\u043d\\.|din|din\\.|\u0631\\.\u064a\\.\u200f|US\\$|Ksh|\u062f\\.\u062a\\.\u200f|CFA|DT|MAD|B\\\/\\.|NT\\$|FCFA|so\u02bbm|UM|Db|CVE|man\\.|EC\\$|PLN|\u0dbb\u0dd4\\.|\u0631\\.\u0633\\.\u200f|\u062c\\.\u0645\\.\u200f|\u0631\\.\u0639\\.\u200f|\uffe5|CA\\$|ALL|K\u010d|\u062f\\.\u0625\\.\u200f|\u0564\u0580\\.|\u17db|\u062f\\.\u0643\\.\u200f|\u0644\\.\u0644\\.\u200f|Afl\\.|\u0441\u043e\u043c|LEI|kn|kr|kr\\.|KM|Ft\\.|VT|FC|\u0641\\.\u062c\\.\u0642\\.\u200f|Fr\\.|SFr\\.|FCFP|m\\.|\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0644|FG|\u062c\\.\u0633\\.|\u062f\\.\u062c\\.\u200f|\u041a\u041c|R\\$|Lek\u00eb|\u09f3|\u062f\\.\u0644\\.\u200f|\u0644\\.\u0633\\.\u200f|Nu\\.|\u043c\u0430\u043d\\.|\u20a1|\u0e3f|\u20a6|\u20a9|\u1265\u122d|\u20aa|\u20ab|\u20ac|\u20ad|\u20ae|\u20b1|\\$|S\\$|\u20b2|GEL|TRY|\u20b4|\u20b8|\u20b9|\u20ba|\u20bd|Kz|LS|RF|MOP\\$|GH\u20b5|D|E|\u062f\\.\u0639\\.\u200f|FBu|G|\u062f\\.\u0645\\.\u200f|Ft|K|RM|L|USh|P|Q|Le|R|S|Rs\\.|NAf\\.|DKK|\u060b|Ar|C\\$|MK))[ ]?((?:[0-9]{1,3}[ \\.,]?)*[ \\.,]?[0-9]+)[ ]*(billion|million|bln|mln|bn|mn|m|B|M)*\/gm","replace":"","state":"{\"substEnabled\":false}"}
