{"id":"49405","urlID":"302dn","name":"Hello World","description":"Now and then a unique home of family proportions with family facilities presents itself to the market. And this is it. The kids live upstairs with their own bathroom and deck, and mum and dad have their suite on the ground floor with designer bathroom and wardrobe (with its built in drawers and shelves). The huge basement has as many options as you need - it's a workshop; it's a games room; it's a home office and it's a wine cellar. The kitchen has a dual stainless steel oven, stainless steel microwave, stainless steel benches, and large butler's pantry. The breakfast bar is black granite beautifully complimenting the clean lines of the kitchen. The office, off the generous entrance lobby, would satisfy your need to work from home or provide a relaxing, private area to ruminate. As you would expect with a home of this quality, it's not only wired for sound, but also Sky and network. Outside, the large section (1768 m2) has been terraced to take advantage of the northerely aspect and the middle tier has the chook house, the glass house and the vege garden, all accessible from the basement. And the best news is that the vendors are inviting purchasers who are looking at homes below the current CV (of $790,000). If this home approaches your requirements and you want to live in Hamilton's dress circle, close to amenities and superior schools, you need to make a move now. Ring for a viewing and beat the rush.","content":"","weightedVote":"2.43878","numVotes":"2","author":"MJC","community":"1","dateAdded":"2012-02-19","pattern":"\\d{1,3}(?=(\\d{3})+(?!\\d))","replace":"","state":""}
