The variables can then be used within any setting value entry using\nthe dereferencing syntax shown in the *how to use* section below.\n\n-BUILT-IN VARIABLES\nSETTINGS - Replaced with the full path to the user's settings file\nME       - Replaced with the full path to the user's Jump.ahk file\n\nThese variables are available by default and are handled exactly the same as custom UserVars.\n**BUILT-IN VARIABLE NAMES ARE RESERVED. ENTRIES NAMED THE SAME AS A BUILT-IN ARE IGNORED**\n\n-HOW TO USE\nUse a custom variable within a setting value by preceding its name with a dollar-sign, as\nshown in the example below. The variable will be dereferenced (replaced with its value)\nwhen the shortcut or lookup is launched.\n\n-BENEFITS OF USERVARS\n* UserVars greatly simplify the process of adding and managing setting entries by reducing\n  the amount of unnecessary duplicate text\n* Readability and organization of settings is greatly increased by using UserVars\n* UserVars allow for the easy creation of dynamic\/context-sensitive setting values, as shown\n  in the example below\n\n-EXAMPLE\n\t[UserVars]\n\tMDOCS = %USERPROFILE%\\Documents\n\tPF = C:\\Program Files\n\t \n\t[ShortCuts]\n\tsomeFile = $MDOCS\\myFile.exe\n\tmyProg = $PF\\SomeFolderName\\something.exe\n\n=SHORTCUTS\nThe user's list of shortcut entries. A shortcut entry consists of a trigger string\nand a command; when a shortcut's trigger is entered, its corresponding command is passed\nto the command line and executed. See the [shortcutSettings] section and the [UserVars]\nsection for more info on creating and customizing shortcuts.\n\n-EXAMPLE\n\t[shortcuts]\n\tie = C:\\Program Files\\Internet Explorer\\iexplore.exe\n\n=SHORTCUT SETTINGS\nSettings that define special ","weightedVote":"2.5","numVotes":"0","author":"WSNHapps","community":"1","dateAdded":"2014-09-24","pattern":"^([=-])([A-Z][A-Z-_:]+(?:(?:[^\\r\\n]\\s[A-Z-_:]+)?)+)$","replace":"$2\\r\\n$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1","state":""}
